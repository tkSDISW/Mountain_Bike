       "<h3>1. Purpose of the Diagram</h3>\n",
       "<p>The diagram named \"[LAB] Mountain Bike All (Messy)\" represents a system model of a mountain bike, its interaction with the environment, and various components involved in the riding process. This is derived from the set of nodes included, which are detailed functional and structural components of a mountain bike system. The key focus seems to be on the interactions and functional exchanges between these components, indicating an aim to map out the system's functionality within different terrains and riding scenarios.</p>\n",
       "<h3>2. Nodes Representation in ARCADIA and Diagram Description</h3>\n",
       "<p>In the ARCADIA method (Architecture Analysis and Design Integrated Approach), nodes serve as the cornerstone to define system architecture, interactions, components, or functions. Each node in this YAML file is a part of the system functioning or a logical representation of a system element.</p>\n",
       "<ul>\n",
       "<li><strong>Logical Functions:</strong> These nodes represent the tasks and operations the system performs. For example, \"Transfer Force from rider to wheel\" or \"Dampen Force from Wheels\" are logical functions that describe what each subsystem does.</li>\n",
       "<li><strong>Parts and Components:</strong> Nodes such as \"Mountain Bike,\" \"Drive Train,\" \"Cockpit,\" etc., represent physical and logical components of the system. They define structural parts within the mountain bike.</li>\n",
       "<li><strong>Functional Chains:</strong> These nodes, such as \"Stopping,\" \"Powering,\" \"Steering,\" etc., indicate sequences of functions that enable complex capabilities of the bike system under various conditions and terrains.</li>\n",
       "<li><strong>Functional Exchanges:</strong> These represent the interactions or exchanges that occur between different parts or functions. E.g., \"FunctionalExcahnge 17\" and \"Gear Selection\" illustrate how various functions communicate or transfer outputs and inputs.</li>\n",
       "<li><strong>Mountain Trails Logical Component:</strong> This is a higher-level node categorizing the environment interactions, associated with components like \"Rugged Terrain\" and \"Obstacles\" which are essential to understanding the environmental context of the mountain bike usage.</li>\n",
       "</ul>\n",
       "<p>The diagram essentially maps the integrated viewpoint of structural components, functional processes, and informational exchanges between these components, relevant to specific use-cases and real-world scenarios encountered during mountain biking.</p>\n",
