       "<h3>1. Purpose of the Diagram</h3>\n",
       "<p>The diagram named \"[LAB] Mountain Bike All (Messy)\" is intended to represent a comprehensive system model of a mountain bike and its interaction with various components and terrains. The purpose of this diagram is to capture an intricate and detailed depiction of how the mountain biking system operates, incorporating multiple logical functions, parts, and exchanges that are interrelated to describe the behavior and interactions within the system.</p>\n",
       "<p>By analyzing its related nodes and components, this diagram serves to demonstrate a robust and systematic design model representing real-world interactions and functionalities in mountain biking. This includes capturing aspects like force transmission, terrain interaction, braking, comfort provisions, and more, which are vital for understanding and improving mountain biking dynamics.</p>\n",
       "<h3>2. Nodes Representation in ARCADIA Method</h3>\n",
       "<p>In the ARCADIA (Architecture Analysis &amp; Design Integrated Approach) method, the diagram utilizes several key concepts that include:</p>\n",
       "<ul>\n",
       "<li><strong>Logical Functions:</strong> Such nodes as \"Transfer Force from rider to wheel,\" \"Provide Comfort,\" and \"Convert Pedal Force to Wheels\" represent the functional aspects of the mountain bike system. They illustrate how different actions and processes are executed in the system.</li>\n",
       "<li><strong>Functional Exchanges:</strong> Nodes like \"FunctionalExchange 1\" and \"Gear Selection\" denote exchanges between functions, showcasing the flow of information or energy between different parts of the system.</li>\n",
       "<li><strong>Parts:</strong> Components such as \"Mountain Bike,\" \"Wheels and Tires,\" and \"Drive Train\" represent the physical elements of the mountain bike. In ARCADIA, these elements are critical as they provide context for how systemic functions are carried out in the physical domain.</li>\n",
       "<li><strong>Logical Components:</strong> Nodes representing larger subsystems or logical groupings of parts and functions, such as \"Mountain Trails\" and \"Mountain Bike,\" encapsulate complete sets of interactions and allocations which are, in essence, blueprints for how the system functions together holistically.</li>\n",
       "<li><strong>Constraints:</strong> Though sparse in this YAML file, constraints provide restrictions or conditions within which the system operates.</li>\n",
       "</ul>\n",
       "<h3>3. Diagram's Description</h3>\n",
       "<p>The diagram systematically models the interaction of forces and control elements as a mountain biker traverses various terrains. It captures essential operations of a mountain bike, from receiving inputs like pedal force or steering adjustments to managing outputs such as speed and friction control. The ARCADIA method effectively breaks down complex components and functions into manageable and analyzable interactions, revealing potential areas for design improvement or optimization in bike performance over different types of trails.</p>\n",
       "<p>Overall, this diagram within the context of ARCADIA method provides a structured insight to architects, engineers, and designers aiming to optimize the design for enhanced performance and rider control.</p>\n",

    "\n",
    "### Purpose\n",
    "This cell launches an interactive chat session based on the structured input file, leveraging ARCADIA and Polarion terminology to ensure the analysis remains consistent with the modeling context.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features\n",
    "- Uses the generated structured input file (e.g., `capella_model.yaml`) to guide the conversation.\n",
    "- Supports ARCADIA terms such as **functions**, **components**, **activities**, and **exchanges**.\n",
    "- Incorporates Polarion terms like **workitem**, **requirement**, and **traceability** for seamless integration with requirements management workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "1. The structured input file provides context for the chat session.\n",
    "2. You can interactively query details about the model elements, relationships, and dependencies.\n",
    "3. Responses are tailored using ARCADIA and Polarion terminology.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Prompts\n",
    "- **For ARCADIA:**\n",
    "  ```plaintext\n",
    "  What are the dependencies and exchanges for the selected function in the Logical Architecture phase?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **For Polarion:**\n",
    "  ```plaintext\n",
    "  Provide the traceability matrix for the workitem linked to this component.\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "### üõ†Ô∏è Instructions\n",
    "1. Ensure the `capella_model.yaml` file has been generated and is up-to-date.\n",
    "2. Run this cell to start the interactive chat session.\n",
    "3. Enter your queries using **ARCADIA** or **Polarion** terms for accurate and relevant responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üìù Notes\n",
    "- The interactive chat dynamically adapts to the content in the structured input file.\n",
    "- Use precise and contextual queries to ensure the best results and insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "> üí° **Tip:** If you're unfamiliar with ARCADIA or Polarion terminology, consult the respective documentation or glossary for guidance.\n",
