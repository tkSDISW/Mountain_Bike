       "<p>\n",
       "        The diagram titled <strong>[LAB] Mountain Bike All (Messy)</strong> serves as a comprehensive illustration of a mountain bike system model. It organizes and depicts the relationships and interactions among various components involved in a mountain biking experience. The diagram's purpose is to provide an overview of how different elements of the system, such as trails, terrain, bike components, and biking actions, are interconnected to ensure a successful biking adventure.\n",
       "    </p>\n",
       "<p>\n",
       "        The related nodes in the diagram emphasize various aspects relevant to mountain biking, like \"Mountain Trails\", \"Rugged Terrain\", \"Obstacles\", and specific biking operations like \"Prep for Ride\", \"Ride\", and \"Execute Ride\". These components all interplay to address the broader aims of maximizing performance, comfort, and safety during mountain bike rides.\n",

       "<h2>2. Nodes Representation in ARCADIA and Description of the Diagram</h2>\n",
       "<p>\n",

       "<ul>\n",
       "<li><strong>Logical Components:</strong> Components such as <em>Mountain Trails</em>, <em>Mountain Bike</em>, including its parts like <em>Frame and Suspension</em>, <em>Drive Train</em>, etc., represent structural elements and subsystems in the bike's architecture.</li>\n",
       "<li><strong>Logical Functions:</strong> The nodes labelled as logical functions (like <em>Rugged Terrain</em>, <em>Dampen Force from Wheels</em>) illustrate the actions or processes that these components are supposed to execute.</li>\n",
       "<li><strong>Functional Exchanges:</strong> Illustrate the information flow between the functions and components, for instance, conveying interactions such as <em>Observations</em> or <em>Transfer Force from rider to wheel</em>.</li>\n",
       "<li><strong>Functional Chains:</strong> Group of logical functions and exchanges that together encapsulate a specific behavior or capability, like <em>Comfort</em>, <em>Handling</em>, etc.</li>\n",

       "        The overall diagram is an architectural view capturing how a mountain bike's components interact with mountainous environments and how they cater to the rider's requirements, aiming for an efficient and enjoyable ride. At its core, this diagram is describing the interactions and dependencies among physical and logical components of a mountain biking system, mapping out how energy and control are transferred across different subsystems, and how adjustments like terrain and rider input impact performance.\n",

    "This cell launches an interactive chat session based on the structured input file, leveraging ARCADIA and Polarion terminology to ensure the analysis remains consistent with the modeling context.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features\n",
    "- Uses the generated structured input file (e.g., `capella_model.yaml`) to guide the conversation.\n",
    "- Supports ARCADIA terms such as **functions**, **components**, **activities**, and **exchanges**.\n",
    "- Incorporates Polarion terms like **workitem**, **requirement**, and **traceability** for seamless integration with requirements management workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "1. The structured input file provides context for the chat session.\n",
    "2. You can interactively query details about the model elements, relationships, and dependencies.\n",
    "3. Responses are tailored using ARCADIA and Polarion terminology.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Prompts\n",
    "- **For ARCADIA:**\n",
