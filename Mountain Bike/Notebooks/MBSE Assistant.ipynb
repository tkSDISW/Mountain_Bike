       "<p>The diagram, named \"[OCB] Mountain Bike\", serves to illustrate the relationships and interactions between various entities, capabilities, and operational processes within a mountain biking environment. The purpose is to provide a comprehensive view of the intricate interactions and dependencies that exist in a mountain biking system. This includes how different roles such as riders, manufacturers, and terrain interact to achieve operational capabilities like Terrain Navigation, Durability, and Maneuverability.</p>\n",

       "<p>In the ARCADIA (Architecture Analysis &amp; Design Integrated Approach) method, the nodes and elements within the diagram have specific representations:</p>\n",
       "<ul>\n",
       "<li><strong>Entities:</strong> These are concrete or abstract \"things\" involved in the system, such as \"ACME Bicycles\", \"Bike Rider\", or \"Mountain Trails\". They can be physical entities or more abstract ones like services or capabilities.</li>\n",
       "<li><strong>OperationalActivities:</strong> These are actions performed by entities, such as \"Build Bike\" or \"Ride Trail\". They describe how entities achieve operational goals.</li>\n",
       "<li><strong>FunctionalExchanges:</strong> These describe the interactions between activities and entities, such as \"Interaction 5\" or \"Pedals\". They detail exchanges between entities and activities to fulfill operational processes.</li>\n",

       "<p>The diagram provides an overarching view of a mountain biking ecosystem, highlighting essential aspects like terrain adaptability, user involvement, and product capabilities. It describes how ACME Bicycles (the manufacturer) integrates customer feedback to refine mountain bikes, making them adaptable to diverse terrains and weather conditions. It also depicts the roles of different types of riders‚ÄîMountain Bikers, Road Riders, Fat Tire Riders‚Äîin experiencing and influencing product capabilities through their interactions with the bikes and terrain.</p>\n",

    "### Purpose\n",
    "This cell launches an interactive chat session based on the structured input file, leveraging ARCADIA and Polarion terminology to ensure the analysis remains consistent with the modeling context.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features\n",
    "- Uses the generated structured input file (e.g., `capella_model.yaml`) to guide the conversation.\n",
    "- Supports ARCADIA terms such as **functions**, **components**, **activities**, and **exchanges**.\n",
    "- Incorporates Polarion terms like **workitem**, **requirement**, and **traceability** for seamless integration with requirements management workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "1. The structured input file provides context for the chat session.\n",
    "2. You can interactively query details about the model elements, relationships, and dependencies.\n",
    "3. Responses are tailored using ARCADIA and Polarion terminology.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Prompts\n",
    "- **For ARCADIA:**\n",
    "  ```plaintext\n",
    "  What are the dependencies and exchanges for the selected function in the Logical Architecture phase?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **For Polarion:**\n",
    "  ```plaintext\n",
    "  Provide the traceability matrix for the workitem linked to this component.\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "### üõ†Ô∏è Instructions\n",
    "1. Ensure the `capella_model.yaml` file has been generated and is up-to-date.\n",
    "2. Run this cell to start the interactive chat session.\n",
    "3. Enter your queries using **ARCADIA** or **Polarion** terms for accurate and relevant responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üìù Notes\n",
    "- The interactive chat dynamically adapts to the content in the structured input file.\n",
    "- Use precise and contextual queries to ensure the best results and insights.\n",
